// rather than putting element in continous memory (array) linked list make an block like structure and make block memory for every element in heap
 // distracted counter :- 3 

// only Node only know 2 thing .. 1 their value  .. 2:- whom they are pointing to

// head means very fisrt node ,, and tail means very last node

 // node has an value with it and that value is pointing to next node 
//   class Node {
//     int val;
//     Node next;
//   }

// singly linked list = pointing in forward direction
